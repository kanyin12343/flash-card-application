# flash-card-application

# Introduction
A simple words memorization tool “Flashy” implemented with python and tkinter library to create this application with more intuitive interface for the user.
This tool can help you study and practice new vocabulary for foreign languages by showing flashcards with a word presented in one language and then its translation shown in another.


# Features

Vocabulary terms are loaded from a CSV file.
To view the translation, turn the flashcard over.
Mark phrases as "known" to take them out of use.
3 seconds later, automatic card flipping occurs.




# Usage 
The flashcard will appear in the application window with a French word on the front and the word "word" in lieu of the English translation.

The card will automatically turn over and display the English translation on the back after three seconds.

To indicate if you understood the translation, click the "Wrong" and "Right" buttons. A "Right" click will designate the word as "known" and take it out of practise.

Until there are no more new words to learn, the programme will present new words.
